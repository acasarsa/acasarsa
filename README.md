## About Me

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Andrew, a full stack software engineer who loves working with a team and has a passion for creating clean, maintainable code, and intuitive user experiences. I love working with Ruby on Rails, React, Typescript, and GraphQL.

Check out our 2023 Rails Hackathon [entry](https://be-ai-assist.dev/). We created a fork of the better_errors gem and added an AI assistant to it that analyzes the error data and gives a concise issue and possible solution or suggestions. 

<!-- I've had a rather non-traditional journey so far. It stated with a fascination with consumer culture and blossomed with the dawn of the internet age (showing my age here) and the notion with user psychology. Followed my passion for problem solving and people skills into law school and eventually became admitted to the NYS Bar.  /// Ever since I read Born to Buy I've been fascinated by consumer culture  it started with Law School during the Great Recession, I passed the bar and am admitted in NYS but I couldn't find my passion in the law. I always found myself working on the company's website  // and avid board game player. I'm a career changer with a background in law and website and small business consulting. -->

If you don't see as much activity as usual that's because I'm focusing on expanding my knowledge of computer science concepts and algorithms. I'm also keeping my React knowledge fresh by redoing [Kent C. Dodds Epic React course](https://epicreact.dev/learn). As a break from studying I've been playing around with Python which I was exposed to during our Rails Hackawthon project and have wanted to learn more about. I'm also hoping to find time to do a C/C++ project so I can program something to work with some hardware. As you can see I'm obsessed with broadening my horizons and enjoy dabbling in and learning new languages. My experience and passion is still focused on Rails and React but I've found I understand the choices their creators and maintainers made better after learning and comparing experience with other ones.
